# =========================================================
# Python Mini Projects
# =========================================================

A collection of small command-line Python programs demonstrating
input/output, control flow, functions, and basic arithmetic logic.
Each script is standalone and runs directly with Python.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Getting Started
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (standard library only)

Running a program:
    python filename.py

Example:
    python hello.py
